The ancient Limbo, a realm far older than Edenfell, in which the spiteful deity Nimiane had been confined, imprisoned by the Old Gods, her siblings, was a caustic place hungry for life and for mana, the fuel of magic. Ultimately unsuccessful in their quest to banish Nimiane and close the rift between the two worlds, Limbo quickly consumed these storied explorers and in time, it consumed Edenfell too, spilling out its toxicity in waxing tides that soon engulfed everything as far as the eye can see, forever changing the world as we all know it.

Courier Bats are the fastest known creatures in Edenfell and can cover short distances in a matter of seconds. In Caliburn and Vatha, these bats, barely the size of a fist, keep the cities connected and are such a household item to the point that owned bats wear necklaces or annulets that indicate to whom they belong at a glance.

These contests rarely result in death, and all participants accept the outcome as the final resolution of their disagreements. Consequently, grudges are short-lived, and the council can conduct its business with a degree of civility."

It got its name by being the fast-spinning, precariously deathly location of a battle against a Voidbringer nest and the powerful Voidbringer the UnA have christened Azisi. Suspended hundreds of feet above Ocean Titane and the Boiling Lake, the island's relentless rotation creates a hazardous environment, making it incredibly dangerous for anyone to venture too close. Anything that the spiral drops into the Boiling Lake is often consumed without a trace. The island is not a known site of Voidborn activity and the whereabouts of Azisi are unknown, but the UnA faced significant challenges in their attempts to confront Azisi and neutralize the Voidbringer's threat because the island's unstable nature and the destructive power of the Boiling Lake tested their courage and resourcefulness, as such the name has stuck."

People who understand the forest's secrets venture forth with baskets and bags to collect the treasures of nature. Delicious wild berries with a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness burst with flavor, and glowing mushrooms entice the curious to explore their hidden world. Skilled hunters, armed with ancient knowledge, move silently through the forest, blending in with the wilderness as they seek elusive game or valuable Chasers. However, even in the beauty of the Night Chaser Forest, there is a sense of danger in the northeastern part. People share scary stories of darkness, horror, and fear. Many feel uneasy, catching glimpses of frightening creatures called Voidbringers. It's a region where caution is necessary, and even the bravest adventurers proceed with wariness."

While still largely unexplored, initial ventures into the continent have revealed a lack of overwhelming Voidbringer presence, sparking growing curiosity and excitement among those seeking new knowledge and opportunities. As Lorechasers delve deeper into the uncharted lands and the UnA ensures the safety of expeditions, the New Frontier becomes a symbol of untapped potential, offering a fresh canvas for discovery and exploration beyond the known boundaries of Edenfell."

The consequences of this event transformed Obscuron into a place devoid of life and brimming with constant peril. Poisonous cascading waterfalls are frozen in time, while the very air itself erodes life and stifles the flow of magic. The plants within this forsaken land are trapped in eternal decay, driven to feed on any remaining traces of life, much like the hordes of mindless Voidbringers that roam the continent and its grotesque floating islands, akin to relentless undead zombies.",
